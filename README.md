**This project has been rebranded as Data Gateway**

Data Gateway makes use of the:

- [SD Connect Proxy API](docs/SD-Connect-API.md) 
- [SD Apply/SD Submit Download API](docs/SD-Submit-API.md) 

It builds a FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) layer. Software currently supports Linux, macOS and Windows for:
- [Graphical User Interface](#graphical-user-interface)
- [Command Line Interface](#command-line-interface)

Binaries are built on each release for all supported Operating Systems.

### Requirements

Go version 1.17

Set these environment variables before running the application:
- SD Connect: `FS_SD_CONNECT_METADATA_API` - a metadata API for building the directories, files and their associated information (size, name etc.); `FS_SD_CONNECT_DATA_API` - an API for downloading files;
- SD Apply/SD Submit: `FS_SD_SUBMIT_API` â€“ a comma-separated list of APIs; `SDS_ACCESS_TOKEN` - a JWT for authenticating to the SD Submit download API;
- `FS_CERTS` is required by SD Connect and SD Submit if self signed certificates are used on the APIs.

For test environment use:

```
export FS_SD_CONNECT_METADATA_API=https://connect-metadata-api-test.sd.csc.fi           
export FS_SD_CONNECT_DATA_API=https://connect-data-api-test.sd.csc.fi
export FS_SD_SUBMIT_API=https://test.sd.csc.fi/

# Connection requires a certificate only if using untrusted (e.g. self-signed) certificates
# if signed by a trusted CA, this is not needed
# FS_CERTS should be the path to the file that contains the necessary certificates
# For example:
export FS_CERTS=cert.pem
```

## Graphical User Interface

###  Dependencies

`cgofuse` and its [dependencies on different operating systems](https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse#how-to-build).

Install [Qt for Go](https://github.com/therecipe/qt). Regardless of the operating system, there are multiple ways of installing this package. Required that `GO111MODULE=on`.

### Setup

On linux install required packages and vendor dependencies
```
./dev_utils/setup-linux.sh
```

Note: for some vendor modules there might be warnings such as:
```
INFO[0427] installing full qt/bluetooth                 
go install: no install location for directory /home/<user>/sda-filesystem/vendor/github.com/therecipe/qt/bluetooth outside GOPATH
	For more details see: 'go help gopath'
```
These are ok, and are caused as of go 1.14+ 

### Build and Run

```
qtdeploy build desktop cmd/qt/main.go

# Running the application is slightly different for each operating system
# On macOS:
./cmd/qt/deploy/darwin/qt_project.app/Contents/MacOS/qt_project
# On Linux:
./cmd/qt/deploy/linux/qt_project
# On Windows:
cmd\qt\deploy\windows\qt_project.exe
```

### Deploy

To deploy binary to Virtual Machine (VM):
```
qtdeploy build desktop cmd/qt/main.go
tar -czf deploy.tar.gz -C cmd/qt/deploy linux
```

Copy the archive of the deployment environment, for more details see: [Linux setup](docs/linux-setup.md).

## Command Line Interface

The CLI binary will require a username and password for accessing the SD-Connect Proxy API.

### Build and Run
```
go build -o ./go-fuse ./cmd/cli/main.go
```
Test install.
```
./go-fuse -help                        
Usage of ./go-fuse:
  -alsologtostderr
    	log to standard error as well as files
  -enable string
    	Choose which repositories you wish include in Data Gateway. Possible values: {SD Connect,SD Apply,all} (default "all")
  -http_timeout int
    	Number of seconds to wait before timing out an HTTP request (default 20)
  -log_backtrace_at value
    	when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
  -log_dir string
    	If non-empty, write log files in this directory
  -loglevel string
    	Logging level. Possible values: {debug,info,warning,error} (default "info")
  -logtostderr
    	log to standard error instead of files
  -mount string
    	Path to Data Gateway mount point
  -stderrthreshold value
    	logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
  -update_interval int
    	An interval in seconds which determines how often Data Gateway will be updated (default 3600)
  -v value
    	log level for V logs
  -vmodule value
    	comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging

```
Example run: `./go-fuse -mount=$HOME/ExampleMount` will create the FUSE layer in the directory `$HOME/ExampleMount` for both 'SD Connect' and 'SD Apply'.
